"description": "***For a limited time, if you spend $20 or more in our shop, you will receive $5 off your total purchase. In order to receive this discount you must enter the code SPENDTWENTY at checkout.***\r\n\r\nThis is a PDF e-pattern - This is not a finished item. As soon as we receive payment, you will receive a confirmation email from Etsy with information on how to download the e-pattern.\r\n\r\nThese sea creature appliqués are fun and easy to make.  You will receive patterns and instructions to make six creatures – a sea turtle, seahorse, octopus, shark, fish and crab (sea turtle is not pictured here).  There are also four other sea designs that you can use to create little vignettes – seaweed, starfish, bubbles and coral.  We have appliquéd the designs on 12 1/2” fabric squares to give you ideas for placement of the pieces if you want to make a quilt or you can create your own underwater scenes, combining different elements.  You can appliqué the designs on t-shirts, jackets, tote bags, jeans, etc.\r\n\r\nThe appliqué designs come in one size but they can easily be reduced or enlarged to any size that you would like.  \r\n\r\nThe sizes of the sea creature are as follows:\r\nSea Turtle - 7 1/2&quot; x 7 1/2&quot;\r\nSeahorse - 5&quot; x 10&quot;\r\nCrab - 7 3/4&quot; x 9 1/2&quot;\r\nOctopus - 7 1/2&quot; x 8 1/4&quot;\r\nShark - 4&quot; x 9 1/2&quot;\r\nFish - 7 1/2&quot; x 9 1/4&quot;\r\n\r\nButtons are sewn on for the eyes on the sample creatures.  Other options would be to appliqué and sew black and white circles for the eyes, or embroider the eyes, if you don’t want to use the buttons.  It is not recommended to sew button eyes on appliqués for children under the age of three.  \r\n\r\nInstructions are given to machine stitch around the appliqué designs to finish the edges.  Another option would be to embroider the blanket stitch around the edges of the appliqué pieces.\r\n\r\nThe appliqués can be made for girls and boys.  The edges of the appliqué pieces may fray slightly when washed which will add to the charm of the designs.\r\n\r\nTHIS PDF E-PATTERN INCLUDES:\r\n•\tFull size patterns\r\n•\tMaterials list\r\n•\tDetailed instructions written in English\r\n•\tClear step-by-step color photographs\r\n\r\nPlease see our Shop Policies for selling finished items made from our patterns.",

Leftover wool can be used to apply a design on a felted item (vest, hat, mittens or hand bag).\r\n\r\nThe finished Thyme Tile will make a lovely pocket for a knitted bag, wall hanging to frame (frame is not included), a coaster or a mug rug. \r\n\r\nNeedle felting tools are not included in this kit, but are available at our Etsy store. \r\n\r\nThe process of needle felting is easy and fun for people of all ages. Children ages 9 and up can be very good at it, and may want to create their own designs. Younger children can have fun, however need adult supervision and assistance.  \r\n\r\nFor more information go to our website www.awrinkleinthymefarm.com",

We invite you to visit our farm when you are in the area (just call ahead), and to see what is happening here visit our web site at www.awrinkleinthymefarm.com.\r\n\r\nOur farm is named A Wrinkle in Thyme Farm using the concept of tesseract (time travel) from the book by Madeline L&#39;Engle. At A Wrinkle in Thyme Farm we like to do things the old fashioned way when we can. For example, we use a draft horse for collecting sap for maple syrup, we sometimes dye wool with plants from the farm, and we hand spin for pleasure and family gifts.\r\n\r\n We feature farmspun (not handspun) yarns, made with fiber from our own animals. We shear the animals, wash and dye and sometimes card the fiber.  Our yarn is either 100% wool and 50/50 mohair blend.   We also have 20% angora from local Maine rabbits blended with 80% of our own Finnsheep wool. Each 150 yard skein of yarn is tagged with an image of the animal that grew it. In summer we dye wool using plants from the farm to create soft colors. We also use acid dyes for a rainbow of brighter and pastel colors.\r\n\r\nWe offer Fiber CSA shares, Thyme Tile patterns for needle felting, pocket bags, and pocket bag kits. Workshops at the farm include dyeing with plants, felting landscapes, and fun dyeing techniques using acid dyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

"description": "There is some confusion over this tiny flask, the Auctioneer thought it was a hip flask for spirits, another said it was a perfume flask.  True, we have never seen a brass hip flask before, but the inside of the screw lid has a cork liner, which a perfume flask would not have.  We like to think that the tapered shape and size of this flask would fit into the pocket of a hacking or Hunting Pink jacket.  The painting on the oval relief is beautiful, a real horse racing find!  This diminutive sized flask is smooth and in good condition with no dents, it is of good age, there is a small area of wear on the lid (as shown in photo).  A really super find.  A rough estimate at the auction was early 20th century (1910-30) but no amount of investigation has given us any further details on an exact date.",

"announcement": "At CoopsRetroBar we are passionate about Breweriana.  We try to source as many interesting, diverse and collectable items from English Inns, Pubs, bars and taverns as we can, frequenting Auctions is our hobby!  We also have bits from Europe and the USA in our collection.\r\n\r\n  We have our own home bar, we choose our bar for parties, get-togethers and family occasions.  Don&#39;t get us wrong, we still frequent our local pub, its a vital part of the community, but we now have an additional local, right next door, and its cheaper on taxi       fares.  \r\n\r\nOur bar has a 70&#39;s theme, so what began as sourcing unusual vintage items, became a complete passion, which we wanted to share, so CoopsRetroBar was born.  From Auctions, salerooms, Antique Shops and garage and boot sales, we have gathered together all the items you need to stock your own home bar, or to add to your Breweriana collection.\r\n\r\nVintage items can have alternative uses, an ashtray can be used for somewhere to keep your earrings, or as a soap dish. A whisky water jug makes a great milk cream or gravy jug.   Our own gravy boat here at home is a Jamesons water jug, a great table addition. Its fun and quirky to have these items around the house. \r\n\r\nA comprehensive catalogue of goodies, our shop is filled with iconic names from the alcohol and tobacco industries, some, sadly no longer with us. All our items have had a previous life, most of them have lived in pubs, bars and clubs.  Their condition will reflect use, but we will always point out faults and defects using photos and descriptions.  That said, the quality of our stock is first rate, with only a handful having any real problems and we offer those only because they are iconic and true retro items, the cost will be reduced acordingly.   Please be assured of our aim to provide high quality items to you at all times. \r\n\r\n\r\nHave lots of fun incorporating these great vintage items into your bar and home, and enjoy wallowing in your mis-spent youth as much as we do. Welcome - It&#39;s Opening Time - Wendy and Nigel Cooper.\r\n",

"description": "This haunting horse head image was created by me in pastel. The original painting was 16&quot; x 20&quot;, and has sold. Looking out of the darkness, his partially lit face to me has a lot of drama to it.\r\n\r\nBeautifully printed centered on 8-1/2&quot; x 11&quot; Ultra Premium Art Paper. Image size is approximately 7&quot; x 10&quot;. Each print is hand signed in the lower right hand border and is titled and signed on the back, unless stated otherwise.. Copyright will not appear on ordered print. Frame not included.\r\n\r\nThis image can be reproduced any size larger or smaller that it will go proportionately on paper or canvas, stretched or ready for stretching. This image on canvas looks awesome! Canvas or larger sizes will require more shipping time. Prices on request.\r\n\r\nThe print colors may very slightly from published image.\r\n\r\nYour paper print will be shipped with backing board in a poly sleeve.",

"description": "Woooie Pattern ONLY, horn not included in this pattern.\r\nMy very dearest treasure that I have loved and cherished for many years can now be yours too. Create a Woooie (Hobby Horse) of your very own. This PDF pattern allows you to sell the finished products under this agreement: \r\n\r\nSTOP THE HORSES!!!! Check this out!  \r\n\r\nTo compliment your Woooie you can now get 5 different digital embroidery patterns for the eyes!!! If you do not have an embroidery machine you can take your file to an embroidery company and have them make them for you. All you have to do then is sew them on or use heat and bond ultra!!!! Eyes Available (original eye, Eye with Star, Eye with Heart, Boy Eye with Lashers and Girl Eye with Lashers!) please follow this link to purchase the eyes. Please understand under Copy Right Laws we reserve the right to restrict the eyes to PERSONAL USE ONLY and they are not to be sold as a set or individually to others.\r\n \r\n(Iron-On Ready made eyes available: email for enquiries whimsywoo@bigpond.com)\r\n\r\n* All items made using this pattern can be sold, however on tags, signage and internet listings you will need to credit WhimsyWoo, with a link to this store or Facebook page, for the creation of the pattern you used. If you modify the pattern, credit is still due with reference to where you originally started, this is simply to ensure I can continue to sell my very precious treasure and enable others to enjoy it and have fun with it too.
